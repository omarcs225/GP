# üöó SDV-OTA: Secure OTA Framework with AI-Driven Predictive Scheduling

A reference framework for **secure and efficient Over-the-Air (OTA) updates** in **Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs)**.

This project introduces a novel **AI-driven predictive scheduling mechanism** that intelligently selects the **optimal update window** based on **driver usage patterns, charging cycles, and connectivity conditions**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîê Security First** ‚Äì TLS 1.3, package signing, fail-safe rollback (A/B partitioning)
- **ü§ñ AI Scheduling** ‚Äì Learns from trip data to predict idle/charging windows
- **‚ö° Efficiency** ‚Äì Delta updates, compression, multicast distribution
- **üõ°Ô∏è Resilience** ‚Äì Handles network/power failures gracefully with rollback

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CMake 3.16+
- GCC/Clang compiler
- Docker (optional)

### 1. Backend Service

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend service will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. AI Scheduler

```bash
cd ai_scheduler
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
uvicorn src.service:app --reload --port 5055
```

The AI scheduler service will be available at `http://localhost:5055`

### 3. Vehicle Agent

```bash
cd vehicle_agent
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/agent --config config/agent.toml
```

---

## üìä Expected Outcomes

- **Secure OTA pipeline** with cryptographic guarantees
- **AI scheduler** predicting >85% accuracy for idle windows
- **Bandwidth savings** via delta updates (~70% reduction)
- **Seamless OTA updates** with minimal driver disruption

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The SDV-OTA framework consists of three main components:

### Backend Service
- Manages update packages and metadata
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Provides REST API for vehicle communication
- Implements delta update generation

### AI Scheduler
- Machine learning model for usage pattern analysis
- Predicts optimal update windows
- Considers charging cycles and connectivity
- Learns from historical trip data

### Vehicle Agent
- C++ agent running on vehicle ECUs
- Handles secure update downloads
- Implements A/B partitioning for rollback
- Manages local update verification

---

## üîê Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Components
- **TLS 1.3** for secure communications
- **Digital signatures** for package integrity
- **Certificate chain validation** for authenticity
- **A/B partitioning** for safe rollback

### Security Standards Compliance
- ISO/SAE 21434 (Cybersecurity Engineering)
- UNECE WP.29 (Cybersecurity and Software Update)
- Uptane framework for automotive updates

### Key Management
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Keys in `/security/pki` are for **demonstration purposes only**.

For production deployment:
- Integrate with Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- Use Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for secure storage
- Implement proper certificate lifecycle management
- Follow automotive cybersecurity best practices

## ü§ñ AI Scheduler Details

The AI scheduler uses machine learning to optimize update timing by analyzing:

- **Driver behavior patterns** (trip frequency, duration, timing)
- **Charging cycles** (home/work charging schedules)
- **Connectivity quality** (WiFi availability, cellular strength)
- **Vehicle state** (parked vs driving, battery level)

### Training Data
- Historical trip logs
- Charging session data
- Network connectivity metrics
- Update success/failure rates

### Model Performance
- Target: >85% accuracy in predicting suitable update windows
- Reduces update interruptions by intelligent scheduling
- Adapts to changing driver patterns over time

---

## ‚ö° Efficiency Features

### Delta Updates
- **Binary diff algorithms** to minimize download size
- **~70% bandwidth reduction** compared to full updates
- **Incremental updates** for frequent small changes

### Distribution Optimization
- **Multicast delivery** for fleet-wide updates
- **Edge caching** to reduce server load
- **Compression** to further reduce bandwidth usage

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && python -m pytest

# AI scheduler tests
cd ai_scheduler && python -m pytest

# Vehicle agent tests
cd vehicle_agent && ctest --build-config Debug
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all services with proper networking and dependencies.
